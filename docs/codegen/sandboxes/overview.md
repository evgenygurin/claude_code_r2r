# Code Execution Sandboxes

Codegen agents operate within secure, isolated sandbox environments where they can safely execute code and run commands without affecting your local machine or production systems.

<Tip>
  Codegen's sandbox environments are highly configurable and built for
  enterprise workloads

## Capabilities

Each sandbox provides a controlled environment with:

* **File System Access:** Read, write, and modify files within the sandbox's temporary file system.
* **Terminal Access:** Execute shell commands (`bash`, `sh`, etc.) to run scripts, linters, formatters, build tools, and other necessary commands.
* **Process Execution:** Run code in various languages (Python, Node.js, etc., depending on the sandbox image).
* **Networking:** Controlled network access for tasks like installing packages or fetching data (can be restricted).

## How Agents Use Sandboxes

Agents utilize sandboxes for a variety of tasks:

* **Testing Code:** Running unit tests, integration tests, or linters against the code they've written or modified.
* **Verifying Changes:** Executing the code to ensure it runs correctly before committing.
* **Installing Dependencies:** Using package managers (`pip`, `npm`, `yarn`) to install necessary libraries.
* **Running Tools:** Executing build scripts, code formatters, or other development utilities.

## Configuration

Sandboxes are typically configured per-agent run or defined within your Codegen settings. You often don't need to manage them directly, but advanced configurations might allow specifying Docker images or environment variables.

<Note>
  Sandboxes maintain file system persistence between agent interactions within
  the same context. For example, when continuing a conversation across different
  Slack messages or Linear comments, the sandbox state is preserved, allowing
  agents to seamlessly continue their work without losing context or having to
  reinstall dependencies.
