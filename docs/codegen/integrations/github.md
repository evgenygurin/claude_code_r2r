# GitHub Integration

GitHub is how Codegen accesses your repository contents and performs all git interactions. Codegen can create PRs from requests or issues, help resolve merge conflicts, conduct code reviews, search through your codebase, and handle the full spectrum of agentic coding workflows—everything flows through GitHub.

## Installation

## How Agents Use GitHub

Agents leverage the GitHub integration to:

* **Implement Changes:** Create branches and commit code directly based on your prompts.
* **Request Reviews:** Open pull requests and automatically request reviews from specified team members.
* **Report Progress:** Comment on related issues or PRs with updates, results, or requests for clarification.
