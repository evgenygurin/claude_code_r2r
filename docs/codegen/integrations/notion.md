# Notion Integration

Notion is your team's knowledge base, and now Codegen can tap into it too. Share PRDs, specs, and documentation with Codegen for technical feedback and implementation. A common workflow: pass a PRD to Codegen and it will provide technical insights, comment directly on the document, and then go implement the features described.

## Installation

Connect your Notion workspace to Codegen to enable agent interactions with your knowledge base.
