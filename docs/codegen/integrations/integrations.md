## Getting Started

Most integrations require authentication and configuration through the [Codegen dashboard](https://codegen.com/integrations). Each integration provides specific capabilities that agents can leverage to assist with your development workflow.

<Tip>
  Start with GitHub and Slack for the most comprehensive development experience,
  then add project management tools like Linear or Jira based on your team's
  workflow.
