# Check Suite Auto-fixer

When GitHub checks fail on a Codegen PR, Codegen agents will automatically "wake up", analyze the failure, and push fix commits.

This intelligent system monitors CI status and proactively resolves issues without manual intervention.

  Configure globally at the organization level or customize settings per
  repository. Enterprise plans can adjust retry limits for optimal performance.

<Tip>
  Codegen will try to fix broken checks 3 times before "tapping out" by default.
  Enterprise customers can customize the retry count per check or per
  repository.

## How Checks Auto-Fixer Works

Codegen continuously monitors your pull requests and automatically responds to check failures:

* **Automatic Detection:** Monitors GitHub check runs and CI status in real-time
* **Intelligent Analysis:** Analyzes build logs, test failures, and error messages to understand root causes
* **Targeted Fixes:** Generates specific code changes to resolve the identified issues
* **Persistent Retry:** Will attempt to fix issues up to 3 times per PR

## What Triggers Auto-Fixing

Check auto-fixing activates when:

* **CI Checks Fail:** Any GitHub check run reports a failure status
* **Build Errors:** Compilation, linting, or build process failures
* **Test Failures:** Unit tests, integration tests, or automated test suites fail
* **Code Quality Issues:** Static analysis tools report violations or warnings

## The Auto-Fix Process

When Codegen auto-fixes a failing PR, it follows this process:

1. **Detect Failure:** Monitor check status and identify when builds break
2. **Analyze Logs:** Grep through CI logs to understand specific failure points
3. **Generate Solution:** Create targeted code changes to resolve identified issues
4. **Apply Fix:** Automatically commit fixes to the same PR branch
5. **Re-validate:** Monitor the new check run to ensure the fix was successful

## Retry Logic

Codegen implements intelligent retry behavior:

* **Default: 3 attempts** per PR to resolve failing checks
* **Enterprise customization** - Enterprise customers can configure retry limits:
  * Set global defaults at the organization level
  * Override per repository in repository settings
  * Customize retry counts per individual check type
* **Progressive analysis** - each retry incorporates learnings from previous attempts
* **Failure escalation** - when retry limit is reached, the issue is flagged for human review

## Configuration Options

The Checks Auto-Fixer can be configured at multiple levels:

### Organization Level

* **Global settings** - Configure default behavior for all repositories
* **Available to all plans** - Enable/disable the feature organization-wide
* **Access via** - Organization Settings → Checks Auto-Fixer

### Repository Level

* **Per-repo overrides** - Customize settings for specific repositories
* **Individual check control** - Enable/disable monitoring per check type
* **Custom instructions** - Provide specific guidance for handling each check
* **Access via** - Repository Settings → Checks Auto-Fixer

### Enterprise Features

* **Custom retry limits** - Set retry counts globally, per repository, or per check type
* **Advanced monitoring** - Granular control over which checks to monitor
* **Priority handling** - Configure high-priority checks for immediate processing

## GitHub Integration

The auto-fix system integrates deeply with GitHub:

* **Check Run Annotations:** Creates detailed feedback with line-specific suggestions
* **PR Comments:** Adds contextual suggestions and explanations
* **Auto-Fix Actions:** Provides one-click fix buttons in the GitHub UI
* **Status Updates:** Real-time updates on fix progress and results

<Note>
  Checks Auto-Fixer only activates for repositories where Codegen has write
  access and the feature is enabled. It respects your repository permissions and
  team workflows.
