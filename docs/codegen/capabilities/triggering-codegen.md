# Triggering Codegen

Codegen is designed to work where you work. Trigger agents from your existing tools and they'll respond right where the conversation started.

## Trigger Methods

### From Your Tools

* **[Slack](/integrations/slack)** - Mention `@codegen` in any channel or DM
* **[Linear](/integrations/linear)** - Assign issues to Codegen or mention in comments
* **[Jira](/integrations/jira)** - Assign issues to Codegen or `@mention` in comments
* **[ClickUp](/integrations/clickup)** - Assign tasks to Codegen or mention in comments
* **[Monday.com](/integrations/monday)** - Assign items to Codegen or mention in comments
* **[GitHub](/integrations/github)** - Comment on PRs or issues with `@codegen-agent`

### From Codegen

* **[Web UI](https://codegen.com/new)** - Start a new agent run directly from the dashboard
* **[CLI](/introduction/cli)** - Run `codegen agent create "your task"` from your terminal
* **[API](/api-reference/agents/create-agent-run)** - Trigger programmatically for automated workflows

## How Agent Context Works

### One Agent Per Context

Each context gets its own dedicated agent:

* **Slack** - Each thread is a separate agent. Follow-up messages in the same thread route to the same agent
* **Linear/Jira/ClickUp/Monday** - Each ticket is a separate agent. All comments on that ticket go to the same agent
* **GitHub** - Each issue or PR is a separate agent. All comments stay with the same agent

### Shared Context with PRs

When an agent creates a PR:

* The agent **always monitors its own PR** and responds to comments
* Agents triggered from tickets (Linear, Jira, etc.) share context between the ticket and any PRs they create
* Follow-up requests on either the ticket or PR route to the same agent
* **Automatically fixes broken tests** - When CI checks fail, the agent wakes up and pushes fix commits

<Note>
  This means you can start a conversation in Linear, have the agent create a PR,
  then continue the discussion on either platform - it's all the same agent with
  full context.
</Note>

<Tip>
  Follow-up messages always go to the same agent. Whether you're continuing a
  Slack thread, commenting on a ticket, or reviewing a PR - the agent maintains
  full conversation history.
</Tip>

## All Agents Created Equal

No matter where you trigger from, your request:

1. Routes to a dedicated agent for that context
2. Runs in secure [sandboxes](/sandboxes/overview)
3. Has access to all your [integrations](/integrations/integrations)
4. Creates trackable runs visible at [codegen.com/agents](https://codegen.com/agents)

## Automatic Triggers

Codegen supports certain automated triggers as first-class citizens. These activate without manual intervention to maintain code quality:

* **[Checks Auto-fixer](/capabilities/checks-autofixer)** - Automatically fixes failing CI checks on agent PRs
* **[PR Review](/capabilities/pr-review)** - Provides instant code review feedback on all PRs

<Note>
  These automations work alongside manual triggers. An agent fixing broken tests
  can still respond to comments on its PR or the original ticket that triggered
  it.
