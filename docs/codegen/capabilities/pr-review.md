  Set up PR review at the organization level, then customize per repository.
</Card>

## How It Works

When PR review is enabled on a repo, a Codegen agent will spin up to leave a detailed review.

This includes:

* **Inline comments** on specific lines with actionable feedback
* **Security scanning** for vulnerabilities and unsafe patterns
* **Code quality** suggestions for maintainability and best practices
* **Architectural feedback** on design patterns and structure

## Configuration

Configure PR reviews at two levels:

### Organization Settings

Set global defaults and organization-wide review rules at [Organization Settings → PR Review](https://codegen.com/settings/review).

### Repository Settings

Override settings and add repository-specific rules at **Repository Settings → Review**.

Repository rules are combined with organization rules for comprehensive coverage. You can:

* Enable/disable PR reviews for the repository
* Add custom review guidelines specific to the codebase
* Define language-specific requirements
* Set repository-specific coding standards

<Tip>
  Start with organization-level settings, then customize individual repositories
  as needed.
</Tip>

<Note>
  PR reviews require read access to your repository. Enable the feature at both
  organization and repository levels to activate reviews.
