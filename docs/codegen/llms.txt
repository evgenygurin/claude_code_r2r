Rate limit: 60 requests per 60 seconds.
- [Ban All Checks For Agent Run](https://docs.codegen.com/api-reference/agents/ban-all-checks-for-agent-run.md): Ban all checks for a PR and stop all related agents.

This endpoint:
1. Flags the PR to prevent future CI/CD check suite events from being processed
2. Stops all current agents for that PR
- [Create Agent Run](https://docs.codegen.com/api-reference/agents/create-agent-run.md): Create a new agent run.

Creates and initiates a long-running agent process based on the provided prompt.
The process will complete asynchronously, and the response contains the agent run ID
which can be used to check the status later. The requesting user must be a member
of the specified organization.

This endpoint accepts both a text prompt and an optional image file upload.

Rate limit: 10 requests per minute.
- [Get Agent Run](https://docs.codegen.com/api-reference/agents/get-agent-run.md): Retrieve the status and result of an agent run.

Returns the current status, progress, and any available results for the specified agent run.
The agent run must belong to the specified organization. If the agent run is still in progress,
this endpoint can be polled to check for completion.

- [List Agent Runs](https://docs.codegen.com/api-reference/agents/list-agent-runs.md): List agent runs for an organization with optional user filtering.

Returns a paginated list of agent runs for the specified organization.
Optionally filter by user_id to get only agent runs initiated by a specific user.

- [Remove Codegen From Pr](https://docs.codegen.com/api-reference/agents/remove-codegen-from-pr.md): Remove Codegen from a PR.

This endpoint performs the same action as banning all checks but with more user-friendly naming.
It:
1. Flags the PR to prevent future CI/CD check suite events from being processed
2. Stops all current agents for that PR
- [Resume Agent Run](https://docs.codegen.com/api-reference/agents/resume-agent-run.md): Resume a paused agent run.

Resumes a paused agent run, allowing it to continue processing.

Note: Setup commands agents are automatically routed to their dedicated resume function.
- [Unban All Checks For Agent Run](https://docs.codegen.com/api-reference/agents/unban-all-checks-for-agent-run.md): Unban all checks for a PR.

This endpoint:
1. Removes the ban flag from the PR to allow future CI/CD check suite events to be processed
2. Handles both URL-based bans and parent-agent-run-based bans
