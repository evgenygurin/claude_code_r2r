# Agent Permissions

Configure what actions the AI agent is allowed to perform across your organization. These permission settings provide fine-grained control over agent capabilities to ensure they operate within your security and workflow requirements.

## Available Permissions

### Enable PR Creation

Control whether the codegen agent is able to create pull requests in your repositories in response to user requests.

**When enabled:**

* Agents can create new pull requests with code changes
* PRs include detailed descriptions and context
* Automatic linking to related issues and discussions
* Supports your standard code review workflow

**When disabled:**

* Agents can still analyze code and provide suggestions
* Code changes are proposed but not committed
* Manual PR creation required for implementing changes
* Useful for read-only or advisory agent roles

### Enable Rules Detection

Allow the agent to automatically detect and apply rules from various rule files in your repositories. You can also configure manual repository rules at [codegen.com/settings/repo-rules](http://localhost:3001/settings/repo-rules).

**Supported rule file formats:**

* `.cursorrules` - Cursor AI editor rules
* `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` - Structured rule files in Cursor directory
* `.windsurfrules` - Windsurf AI editor rules
* `CLAUDE.md` - Claude-specific instructions
* `AGENTS.md` - General agent instructions
* `AGENT.md` - Agent-specific rules

**When enabled:**

* Agents automatically discover and apply repository-specific rules
* Rules are version-controlled alongside your code
* Consistent behavior across team members and environments
* Supports existing AI editor workflows

**When disabled:**

* Only manually configured repository rules are applied
* No automatic file-based rule detection
* Simpler rule management through web interface only

### Enforce Organization-wide Signed Commits

When enabled, **ALL** repositories in this organization will be required to use signed commits via GitHub's API. Individual repositories cannot override this security policy.

**Security benefits:**

* Cryptographic verification of commit authenticity
* Enhanced audit trail for code changes
* Compliance with security policies requiring commit signing
* Protection against commit impersonation

**Important considerations:**

* This is an organization-wide enforcement policy
* Individual repositories cannot disable this requirement
* Ensures consistent security posture across all projects
* May require additional setup for team members' GPG keys

<Warning>
  Enabling organization-wide signed commits affects all repositories and cannot
  be overridden at the repository level. Ensure your team is prepared for this
  requirement before enabling.
</Warning>

## Configuration

Agent permissions are configured at the organization level and provide security boundaries for all agent operations within your organization.

## Best Practices

**Start Conservative:**

* Begin with limited permissions and expand as trust builds
* Enable rules detection to leverage existing team practices
* Consider PR creation permissions based on repository criticality

**Security Considerations:**

* Enable signed commits for organizations with compliance requirements
* Review agent-created PRs before merging, especially initially
* Monitor agent activity through analytics and audit logs

**Team Alignment:**

* Ensure team understands which permissions are enabled
* Provide training on rule file formats if using rules detection
* Establish clear processes for agent-created PRs

<Note>
  Permission settings provide essential guardrails for agent operations while
  maintaining the flexibility to customize based on your organization's security
  and workflow requirements.
