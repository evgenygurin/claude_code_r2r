## User Roles

Codegen uses three distinct roles to ensure proper access control while allowing teams to delegate responsibilities appropriately.

| Feature               |  Member | Manager | Admin |
| --------------------- | :-----: | :-----: | :---: |
| View repositories     |    ✅    |    ✅    |   ✅   |
| Use agents            |    ✅    |    ✅    |   ✅   |
| Manage integrations   |    ❌    |    ✅    |   ✅   |
| Delete repositories   |    ❌    |    ❌    |   ✅   |
| Access billing        |    ❌    |    ❌    |   ✅   |
| Change user roles     |    ❌    |    ❌    |   ✅   |
| Organization settings | Limited | Limited |  Full |

  interactions, integrations, and organizational settings. Changes to roles take
