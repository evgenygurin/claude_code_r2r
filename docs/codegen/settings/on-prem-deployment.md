# On-Premises Deployments

Deploy Codegen on your own infrastructure with complete control over your data and development environment.

<Warning>
  On-premises deployment is available for [Enterprise
  tier](https://codegen.com/pricing) customers.
</Warning>

## How It Works

Codegen is built as a cloud-native Kubernetes application designed for secure, self-hosted deployment. Our architecture allows you to run the entire platform within your own infrastructure while leveraging [your own AI models and API keys](/settings/model-configuration) for complete control over data processing. This deployment model is ideal for teams with stringent data sovereignty requirements, air-gapped environments, or compliance mandates that require all code and development activities to remain within corporate boundaries.

## Deployment Options

Choose the deployment method that best fits your infrastructure:
