## Getting Started

Settings are organized into logical groups for easy configuration:

* **Agent & Repository Settings** - Core agent behavior and permissions that define how agents work
* **Organization Settings** - Repository rules and team management for organizational control
* **Model Configuration** - AI model selection and API key configuration for performance optimization

<Tip>
  Start by configuring repository rules for your most active repositories, then
  optimize model settings based on your team's performance and cost
  requirements.
</Tip>

<Note>
  Some settings may require specific plan tiers or administrative permissions
  within your organization.
