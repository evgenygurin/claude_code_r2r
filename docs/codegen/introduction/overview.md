[Codegen](https://codegen.com) helps you run frontier code agents at scale. It provides the necessary building blocks (sandboxes, integrations, telemetry) for successful enterprise code agent deployments across thousands of teams today.

<Tip>
  Focus on higher-level tasks and leverage Codegen agents to do the low-level
  labor of software engineering.
</Tip>

Think of it as an AI coworker that can understand and solve coding challenges, access your codebase instantly, and interact directly with your development tools.
