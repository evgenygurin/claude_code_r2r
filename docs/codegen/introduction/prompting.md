# Effective Prompting

To get the best results from Codegen, treat it like a skilled teammate: provide clear, specific instructions and sufficient context. Vague requests lead to ambiguous outcomes.

<Tip>
  Codegen is based on Anthropic's Claude 4 Sonnet. You can prompt it similarly to
  ChatGPT or other LLM-based assistants
</Tip>

## The Core Principle: Specificity

Instead of "Fix the user service," try:

> In the `my-web-app` repo (PR #42), refactor the `UserService` class in `src/services/user.ts` to use the `UserRepository` pattern shown in `ProductService`/`ProductRepository`.

If there are specific implementation details you want included, make sure to specify. For example:

> Ensure all tests in `tests/services/user.test.ts` pass and add new tests for the repository with 90%+ coverage. Update the diagram in `docs/architecture/user-service.md`.

## Elements of a Strong Prompt

1. **Scope:** What repository, branch, or files are involved? (e.g., `my-web-app` repo, `PR #42`, `src/services/user.ts`)
2. **Goal:** What is the high-level objective? (e.g., Refactor `UserService`, improve testability)
3. **Tasks:** What specific actions should the agent take? Use a numbered or bulleted list for clarity. (e.g., Extract logic to `UserRepository`, use dependency injection, update tests, update diagram)
4. **Context/Patterns:** Are there existing patterns, examples, or documentation to reference? (e.g., `ProductService`, `ProductRepository`)
5. **Success Criteria:** How will you know the task is done correctly? (e.g., Tests pass, 90%+ coverage, diagram updated)

<Note>
  Clear, detailed prompts empower Codegen agents to deliver accurate results
  faster, significantly streamlining your workflow.
