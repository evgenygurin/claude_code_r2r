# Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What languages does Codegen support?" icon="code">
    The Codegen AI agent leverages modern large language models (LLMs) for code
    understanding and generation. This means it can generally handle tasks
    involving any programming language, configuration format (like JSON, YAML),
    documentation (like Markdown), or other text-based files that current LLMs
    are proficient with. If you have specific needs or find limitations with a
    particular language or format, please let us know!
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is Codegen exact?" icon="scale-balanced">
    The Codegen agent uses large language models to understand and modify code.
    While powerful, its understanding isn't based on formal static analysis and
    may not always be perfectly exact or catch all edge cases like a traditional
    compiler or linter might. It aims for practical correctness based on the
    provided context and instructions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is Codegen suitable for large codebases?" icon="database">
    Yes! Codegen's agent is designed to work effectively on large, real-world
    codebases. You can provide context and specific instructions to help it
    navigate complex projects.

    other development tool that can execute Python code.
