# Authentication

All Codegen API endpoints require authentication using Bearer tokens. You'll need both an API token and your organization ID to get started.

## Get Your Credentials

  Visit the developer settings to generate your API token and find your
  organization ID.
</Card>

## Required Information

### API Token

Your personal API token authenticates all requests to the Codegen API. This token is tied to your user account and inherits your permissions within organizations.

### Organization ID

Most API endpoints require an organization ID to specify which organization's resources you want to access. You can find your organization ID in the developer settings.

## Using Your Credentials

### REST API

Include your API token in the Authorization header for all requests:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN" \
  "https://api.codegen.com/v1/organizations/YOUR_ORG_ID/agent/run"
```

### Python SDK

The Python SDK makes authentication simple:

```python
from codegen import Agent

# Initialize with your credentials
agent = Agent(org_id="YOUR_ORG_ID", token="YOUR_API_TOKEN")

# The SDK handles authentication automatically
task = agent.run(prompt="Fix the bug in user authentication")
```
