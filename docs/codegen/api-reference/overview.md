# Codegen API

The Codegen API provides programmatic access to create and manage AI agents, enabling you to integrate Codegen's capabilities into your own applications and workflows.

## What You Can Do

**[Create and manage AI agents](/api-reference/agents/create-agent-run)** that can write code, fix bugs, and handle development tasks across your repositories with full programmatic control over their execution and monitoring. **[Access your organization data](/api-reference/organizations/get-organizations)** including users, repositories, integrations, and **[programmatically retrieve detailed agent traces](/api-reference/agent-run-logs)** for analysis and debugging.

<Note>
  All agents created through the API are fully configurable and viewable in the
  Codegen web UI at codegen.com, allowing seamless integration between
  programmatic and manual workflows.

## Authentication

All API endpoints require authentication using Bearer tokens and your organization ID.

## Rate Limits

The API includes rate limiting to ensure fair usage:

* **Standard endpoints**: 60 requests per 30 seconds
* **Agent creation**: 10 requests per minute
* **Setup commands**: 5 requests per minute
* **Log analysis**: 5 requests per minute

## Getting Started

### 1. Create Your First Agent Run

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.codegen.com/v1/organizations/{org_id}/agent/run" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "prompt": "Add error handling to the user authentication function",
    "repo_id": 123
  }'
```

### 2. Check Agent Status

```bash
curl "https://api.codegen.com/v1/organizations/{org_id}/agent/run/{agent_run_id}" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### 3. Resume with Follow-up

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.codegen.com/v1/organizations/{org_id}/agent/run/resume" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "agent_run_id": 456,
    "prompt": "Also add unit tests for the error handling"
  }'
```

## Use Cases

**Automated Workflows**

* Trigger agents from CI/CD pipelines when builds fail
* Create agents in response to issue tracking system events
* Automate code reviews and quality checks

**Custom Integrations**

* Build Codegen into your existing development tools
* Create custom dashboards for agent activity
* Integrate with internal systems and workflows

**Batch Operations**

* Process multiple repositories with consistent changes
* Generate setup commands for new projects
* Analyze logs across multiple sandbox environments

## SDKs and Tools

For easier integration, we recommend using our Python SDK which provides a simple wrapper around the API:

**Also available:**

* **[CLI Tool](/introduction/cli)** - Command-line interface for common API operations

<Note>
  The API is RESTful and returns JSON responses. All endpoints support standard
  HTTP status codes and include detailed error messages for troubleshooting.
